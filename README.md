This is a collection of GitHub actions and how to set them with `usethis`(version 2.1.6) that can be found [here](https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v2-branch/examples). When I thought necessary I have added a few additional steps, e.g. when using other services from GitHub or Codecov. The book was built with [**bookdown**](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown).
